        The property was purchased from Rev. Garrett in 1873 at a cost of Rs.
        40,000 by the British Guardians of the minor Maharaja Chamarajendra
        Wadiyar 10 using his personal funds. They were in charge of his
        education and administrative training to ready him to take over his
        reign in 1881 AD. As the young Maharaja did not have a suitable place to
        stay during his training in Bengaluru, this property was purchased and
        transformed. Construction of a palace building was started in April 1874
        and completed by 1878. Mr. Cameron of Lalbagh did the landscaping. Many
        additions and improvements were carried out in subsequent years. In the
        later years, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar added some portions outside
        of Durbar Hall e.g. the twin external staircase and platform for
        musicians.[1] The palace has a floor area of 45,000 sft, and grounds of
        454 acres (183 ha).[2] The sprawling grounds surrounding the Palace is
        used for holding public events including music concerts The palace was
        built in Tudor Revival style architecture with fortified towers,
        battlements and turrets. The interiors were decorated with elegant wood
        carvings, floral motifs, cornices and relief paintings on the ceiling.
        The furniture, which was neo-classical, Victorian and Edwardian in
        style, was bought from John Roberts and Lazarus.
