            An epitome of great architecture and beauty, The Majestic Bangalore
            Palace preserves in it the spice of old regal opulence. Currently
            the central attraction in Bangalore, the palace was built in the
            year 1878. Chamarajendra Wadiyar's British Guardians bought the
            original property in 1873 from the principal of Bangalore Central
            High School, Rev, J Garret, from his funds. The palace is
            extraordinarily vast and spread across 45,000 square feet. A mixture
            of Tudor and Scottish Gothic architecture have resulted into the
            grand palace that we see today.The wooden structure of the palace
            along with the beautiful carvings both inside and outside showcases
            the royal culture in different ways.
